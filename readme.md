Running the Experiments
The experiments are performed in a Jupyter notebook. Here are the steps to run the experiments:

1. Import the necessary libraries: This cell imports the required libraries for the experiments.
2. Define the evaluation function: This cell defines the evaluate_model function that evaluates a model using various metrics.
3. Load and prepare the Penguin dataset: This cell loads the penguin dataset, encodes the categorical features, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, and defines the models to be used.
4. Run the experiments for the Penguin dataset: This cell runs the experiments, evaluates the models, and saves the results to a file.
5. Load and prepare the Abalone dataset: This cell loads the abalone dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, and defines the models to be used.
6. Run the experiments for the Abalone dataset: This cell runs the experiments, evaluates the models, and saves the results to a file.

Output Files
The results of the experiments are saved to two files: penguin_performance.txt and abalone_performance.txt. Each file contains the performance metrics for each model used in the experiments.
